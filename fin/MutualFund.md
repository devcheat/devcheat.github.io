Mutual Funds Classification

    -   Debt mutual funds for stable returns and preservation of capital
-   Liquidity - For open-ended funds, you can redeem all or part of your investment any time you wish and receive the current value of the investments. However, it is important to watch out for lock-in period and exit load fees.

## Types of Mutual Funds


## **1\. Equity Funds**
---
> An equity fund is a mutual fund that invests primarily in stocks. In this way, the investor is able to buy a basket of stocks more easily than buying individual stocks and the investor also reaps the benefits of a diversified portfolio. Equity funds have historically provided the highest rate of return but are also more volatile as they are market dependent. Although, equity funds can generate outstanding returns in a short span of time as well, but investors should ideally have a long term time frame to counter volatility.

Equity funds can be further classified as:

####  According to market capitalization

It is a measure by which we can classify a company's size. It is the current market value of the company's outstanding shares.

-   **Large Cap Funds**: When a larger proportion (>=80%) of the portfolio is invested in stocks of companies with large market capitalization.
-   **Large & Mid Cap Funds**: These funds will invest in both large cap and midcap stocks. The funds would invest at least a minimum of 35 per cent in large cap companies and 35 per cent in mid cap companies.
-   **Multi Cap Funds**: These funds will invest in stocks across large, mid, small market capitalization. The funds would invest at least a minimum of 25 per cent in large cap companies, 25 per cent in mid cap companies and 25 percent in small cap companies.
-   **Flexi Cap Funds**: Flexi Cap Mutual Fund is an open-ended, dynamic equity scheme that invests across various market capitalizations i.e large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps without any fixed allocation requirement as in multi-cap funds. The minimum investment in equity and equity-related instruments needs to be 65% of the total assets of the scheme.
-   **Mid Cap Funds**: When 65% or more of the portfolio is invested in stocks of mid and small size companies. They are usually more volatile than large cap funds.
-   **Small Cap Funds**: When 65% or more of the portfolio is invested in stocks of small size companies. Amongst all equity funds, they are the most volatile but have also provided the highest return over long holding periods.

-   Index funds typically have higher expense ratios than ETFs but have lower transaction costs.
-   All investments / redemptions in an index fund are settled at the NAV price but the market price of ETFs can be at a premium or discount to NAVs due to illiquidity.
-   An investor can invest in index funds through SIP. However, such options are not available in ETFs as they are closed ended funds.
